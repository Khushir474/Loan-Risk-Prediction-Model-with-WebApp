## Abstract
Banks serve as the cornerstone of economic vitality, providing crucial financial support to students, small enterprises, and individuals aiming for stability. They serve as the primary conduit for credit, fuelling economic expansion by facilitating essential purchases and bolstering business operations. The banking sector, a major employer, heavily relies on profitability—a factor directly linked to loan performance. In 2022, FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States employed nearly 2 million individuals, and their ability to pay dividends to shareholders rested significantly on profits derived from loan interests. Loan defaults directly impede this profitability, disrupting asset protection and raising concerns about resource preservation within financial institutions.

Amidst these economic intricacies, loan default prediction assumes paramount importance, not only for banks but also for borrowers. Accurate risk assessment in lending ensures responsible practices, shielding borrowers from the burdens of overwhelming debt and nurturing their financial well-being. Moreover, it plays a pivotal role in maintaining the flow of credit to deserving borrowers, stimulating economic growth by fostering entrepreneurship and sustaining consumer spending. This project embarks on the development of a robust predictive model aimed at identifying potential loan defaults—a proactive step towards securing financial institutions, safeguarding borrowers, and sustaining a conducive lending landscape crucial for fostering economic prosperity.
