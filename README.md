## Abstract
Banks serve as the cornerstone of economic vitality, providing crucial financial support to students, small enterprises, and individuals aiming for stability. They serve as the primary conduit for credit, fuelling economic expansion by facilitating essential purchases and bolstering business operations. The banking sector is also a major employer. In 2022, FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States employed nearly 2 million individuals. Banks primarily generate profits through interest on loans, making loans a cornerstone of their financial stability. Loan defaults directly impact a bank's profitability, creating a compelling case for the proactive identification of potential defaulters. This project centers on this critical aspect, aiming to foresee and mitigate loan defaults through predictive modeling.

Further, identifying loan defaulters in advance holds multifaceted benefits:

- Asset Protection: Shielding the institution's assets and resources
- Borrower's Financial Health: Ensuring responsible lending by predicting risks, thereby safeguarding borrowers from overwhelming debt burdens
- Credit Availability: Facilitating effective risk assessment to maintain credit accessibility for deserving borrowers

## Approach
**Dataset used: [Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itssuru/loan-data/)**  
contains records from the years 2007-2010. Refer data dictionary for descriptions of attributes. 

### Steps to undertake
- [x] Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
Handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numeric variables, scaling/normalizing the data, and handling any outliers or anomalies in the data. In addition, you'll want to address the class imbalance issue by either oversampling the minority class (loans that are not fully paid) or undersampling the majority class (loans that are fully paid).  
-[] Exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data, such as distributions of variables, correlations between variables, and identifying any patterns in the data.  
-[]Feature engineering.  
Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the predictive power of the model.  
-[]Model selection.  
Try several models, such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, or support vector machines (SVM).  
-[]Model training and evaluation.  
Training the selected model on the data and evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
-[]Hyperparameter tuning.  
Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance.   
-[]Create a web app using Gradio.  
-[]Deploying the web app on Spaces.  
-[]Testing the web app.
