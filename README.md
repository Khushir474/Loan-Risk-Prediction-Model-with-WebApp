## Abstract
Banks serve as the cornerstone of economic vitality, providing crucial financial support to students, small enterprises, and individuals aiming for stability. They serve as the primary conduit for credit, fuelling economic expansion by facilitating essential purchases and bolstering business operations. The banking sector is also a major employer. In 2022, FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States employed nearly 2 million individuals. Banks primarily generate profits through interest on loans, making loans a cornerstone of their financial stability. Loan defaults directly impact a bank's profitability, creating a compelling case for the proactive identification of potential defaulters. This project centers on this critical aspect, aiming to foresee and mitigate loan defaults through predictive modeling.

Further, identifying loan defaulters in advance holds multifaceted benefits:

- Asset Protection: Shielding the institution's assets and resources
- Borrower's Financial Health: Ensuring responsible lending by predicting risks, thereby safeguarding borrowers from overwhelming debt burdens
- Credit Availability: Facilitating effective risk assessment to maintain credit accessibility for deserving borrowers
